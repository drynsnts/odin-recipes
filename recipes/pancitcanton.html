        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're short on time, cracking open a Lucky Me! Instant Pancit Canton for a meal is hard to beat. Chowing down on just carbs, however, isn't always our favorite thing.</p>
        <p>We're always looking to add a little something extra to our quick and easy meals, so we went on a quick search for the perfect protein to match with our instant noodles. That's when it dawned on us. A poached egg would go perfect with the noodles.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1  Lucky Me! Pancit Canton (We like to use Chillimansi)</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water and add the Pancit Canton Noodles.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes until the noodles are al dente.</li> 
            <li>Drain the noodles, place on a plate, and mix the seasonings and sauces.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg and poach in the same pot (if you're looking for a perfect poached egg, you may want to do it in a separate pot).</li> 
            <li>Place the poached egg on top of the mixed noodles</li>
            <li>Break the egg and get some of that goodness</li>
        </ol>
